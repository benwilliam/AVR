This is a porject about a LED dotMatrix with a ATmega8 written in C build with GCC.
the core function should work in every C envirement.

the whole project ist published with LGPL.

this library allows you to paint geometric figures on LED dotMatrix like

- circles (allso filles)
- elipse
- rectangle (also filled and/or rotate)
- shift the whole image Up/down/left/right  (also wit 'round' effect)
- paint all ASCII chars where you want

all geometric figures are based on the Bresenham allgorithmus

This function comes with no warrenty!
